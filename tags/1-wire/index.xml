      <description>Maxim integrated invented 1-Wire and produces some 1-Wire interface integrated circuits too. 1-Wire devices usually are simple and use one pin for data and one pin for ground. however, driving power from the data line (parasite power) has some limitations that usually is noted in the datasheet. For example, with parasitic power, it takes a long time to measure or convert data. Maxim has a good tutorial on 1-Wire. Unfortunately, it is in flash format (who uses flash these days!</description>
